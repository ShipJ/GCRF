first make sure you get all the scripts fresh from dropbox as I have updated
a few of them.

Use sen_aggregate.py (civ_aggregate.py) to create total_vol.npy

sen1.py (civ1.py) create a number of files, but they also do a bunch of other
things not necessary and have not been written in the same way as the rest of
the scripts so skip this step for now. I've included the files they produce on
Dropbox.

If you want you can try to reproduce the Senegal wealth index by using the
example in wealth_index.R, or skip as the ouput is already on Dropbox.
Don't worry about repeating for Nigeria at the moment as we first need to find
the boundary shapefiles.

The files needed for the next steps can be found on Dropbox
- data/*/telco
    bts_xzero.csv
    bts_hex1000_labels.csv
    hex1000_bts_capital_centroids.csv
    hex1000_bts_centroids.csv
    hex1000_bts_noncapital_centroids.csv
- data/*/geo
    CIV_adm.zip
    CIV14adjv1_utm30.tif.zip
    grid_points_500.csv
    hex_grid_1000.csv
- data/*/poverty
    dhs_cluster_wealth.csv

then if config.py and the directory tree are set up properly you should be
able to run theses scripts:

python bts_aggregation.py sen hex 1000
python radiation.py sen hex 1000
python gravity.py sen hex 1000
python features2.py sen hex 1000
python sampling.py sen
python spatial_lag.py sen

then use modelling.R to produce the final model output
run this interactively in Rstudio or the like
replace data_dir on line 70

then for Ivory Coast repeat above replacing 'sen' with 'civ' and in modelling.R
also replace the loc_tag on line 71 with 'civ'.
